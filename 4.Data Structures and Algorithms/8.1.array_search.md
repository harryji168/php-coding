The `in_array()` and `array_search()` functions in PHP are both used to search for a value in an array, but they serve slightly different purposes and return different types of results.

1. **in_array()**

The `in_array()` function is used to check if a certain value exists in an array. It returns a boolean value: `true` if the value is found in the array, and `false` otherwise. It does not tell you where the value is located within the array.

```php
$array = array("apple", "banana", "cherry");
if(in_array("banana", $array)) {
    echo "Banana is in the array";
} else {
    echo "Banana is not in the array";
}
```

2. **array_search()**

The `array_search()` function is used to search for a specific value in an array, and returns the key of the value if found. If the value is found more than once, the first matching key is returned. If the function fails to find the value, it returns `false`.

```php
$array = array("apple", "banana", "cherry");
$key = array_search("banana", $array);
if($key !== false) {
    echo "Banana is found at position: " . $key;
} else {
    echo "Banana is not found";
}
```

In this example, `$key` will be 1 because "banana" is at the second position in the array, and arrays are 0-indexed.

So, the main difference between `in_array()` and `array_search()` is that `in_array()` simply checks if a value exists in the array, while `array_search()` checks if a value exists and also returns the key of its first occurrence.
