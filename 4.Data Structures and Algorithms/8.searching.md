Searching is the algorithmic process of finding a particular item in a collection of items. There are two types of searching algorithms: linear search and binary search.

1. **Linear Search**

Linear search is the simplest search algorithm and it works by sequentially checking each element of the list until a match is found or all elements have been checked.

Here's a PHP implementation of linear search:

```php
function linearSearch($arr, $target) {
    for ($i = 0; $i < count($arr); $i++) {
        if ($arr[$i] == $target) {
            return $i;
        }
    }
    return -1;  // Return -1 if the target is not found
}

$arr = array(10, 20, 80, 30, 60, 50, 110, 100, 130, 170);
$target = 110;
$result = linearSearch($arr, $target);

if($result != -1) {
    echo "Element is present at index " . $result;
} else {
    echo "Element is not present in the array";
}
```

2. **Binary Search**

Binary search is a faster search algorithm that works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one. However, it requires that the list be sorted first.

Here's a PHP implementation of binary search:

```php
function binarySearch(array $arr, $target): int {
    $left = 0;
    $right = count($arr) - 1;

    while ($left <= $right) {
        $mid = intdiv($left + $right, 2);

        // Check if target is present at the mid
        if ($arr[$mid] == $target) {
            return $mid;
        }

        // If target is greater, ignore left half
        if ($arr[$mid] < $target) {
            $left = $mid + 1;
        }

        // If target is smaller, ignore right half
        else {
            $right = $mid - 1;
        }
    }

    // Return -1 if we reach here (element is not present)
    return -1;
}

$arr = array(2, 3, 4, 10, 40);
$target = 10;
$result = binarySearch($arr, $target);

if($result != -1) {
    echo "Element is present at index " . $result;
} else {
    echo "Element is not present in the array";
}
```

Remember, binary search is significantly more efficient than linear search for large lists, but it does require that the list is sorted. If the list is not sorted, you would need to sort it before applying binary search, which might not be the most optimal solution depending on the specific context.
