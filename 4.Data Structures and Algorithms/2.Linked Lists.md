Linked lists are a type of data structure where each element (called a node) contains a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence. Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node in the list. 

PHP does not provide a built-in linked list, but it is possible to implement a basic linked list using PHP classes.

Here is an example of how you could define a simple singly-linked list in PHP:

```php
class Node {
    public $data;
    public $next;

    public function __construct($data) {
        $this->data = $data;
        $this->next = null;
    }
}

class LinkedList {
    private $head;

    public function insert($data) {
        $newNode = new Node($data);

        if($this->head == null) {
            $this->head = $newNode;
        } else {
            $lastNode = $this->head;
            while($lastNode->next != null) {
                $lastNode = $lastNode->next;
            }

            $lastNode->next = $newNode;
        }
    }

    public function display() {
        $listData = array();
        $current = $this->head;
        while($current != null) {
            array_push($listData, $current->data);
            $current = $current->next;
        }

        foreach($listData as $data) {
            echo $data . "\n";
        }
    }
}

$linkedList = new LinkedList();
$linkedList->insert('3');
$linkedList->insert('5');
$linkedList->insert('7');
$linkedList->display();
```

In this code:

1. The `Node` class represents a node in the linked list. It has two properties: `$data` (to hold the node's data) and `$next` (to reference the next node in the list).

2. The `LinkedList` class represents the linked list itself. It has a `$head` property to keep track of the first node in the list. It also has two methods: `insert()` (to add a node at the end of the list) and `display()` (to print out all of the data in the list).

3. Finally, the `insert` and `display` methods are used to add nodes to the list and print out the list's contents.

This is a simple example, but linked lists can have many more operations like insert at position, delete node, search for an element, etc. You can also have different types of linked lists such as doubly-linked lists and circular linked lists.
