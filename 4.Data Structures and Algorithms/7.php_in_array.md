In PHP, there are a few functions and methods that are used to search for certain elements in data structures like arrays and strings. Here are a few examples:

1. **in_array() Function**

The `in_array()` function is used to check if a value exists in an array. This function returns `true` if the value is found in the array, and `false` otherwise.

```php
$fruits = array("apple", "banana", "cherry");
if(in_array("banana", $fruits)) {
    echo "Banana is found!";
} else {
    echo "Banana is not found!";
}
```

2. **array_search() Function**

The `array_search()` function is used to search for a specific value in an array and return the key. If the value is found more than once, the first matching key is returned. If it fails to find the value, it returns `false`.

```php
$fruits = array("apple", "banana", "cherry");
$key = array_search("banana", $fruits);
if($key !== false) {
    echo "Banana is found at position: " . $key;
} else {
    echo "Banana is not found!";
}
```

3. **strpos() Function**

The `strpos()` function is used to find the position of the first occurrence of a substring in a string. This function is case-sensitive.

```php
$text = "Hello, world!";
$position = strpos($text, "world");
if($position !== false) {
    echo "'world' is found at position: " . $position;
} else {
    echo "'world' is not found!";
}
```

4. **stripos() Function**

The `stripos()` function is a case-insensitive version of `strpos()` function.

```php
$text = "Hello, world!";
$position = stripos($text, "WORLD");
if($position !== false) {
    echo "'WORLD' is found at position: " . $position;
} else {
    echo "'WORLD' is not found!";
}
```

Remember that `strpos()` and `stripos()` can return 0 (as positions in strings are 0-based in PHP), so always use the `!== false` comparison to properly handle the case when the substring is found at the start of the string. If you used just `!=`, it would not differentiate between `false` and `0`, and could therefore give incorrect results.
