In PHP, there are no built-in classes for Trees and Graphs. However, you can easily create your own using classes and objects. Here's how you might represent a Tree and Graph data structure:

**Trees:**

A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of "nodes", where each node contains a value or condition and has two or more "children". Here's a simple implementation of a binary tree (a tree where each node has up to two children):

```php
class Node {
    public $value;
    public $left;
    public $right;

    public function __construct($item) {
        $this->value = $item;
        // new nodes are leaf nodes
        $this->left = null;
        $this->right = null;
    }
}

class BinaryTree {
    public $root;

    public function __construct($item) {
        $this->root = new Node($item);
    }
}

// create new binary tree
$tree = new BinaryTree(1);
// add left child to root
$tree->root->left = new Node(2);
// add right child to root
$tree->root->right = new Node(3);
```

**Graphs:**

A graph data structure consists of a finite set of vertices (or nodes) and a set of edges which connect a pair of nodes. Graphs can be either directed (edges have direction) or undirected. Here's a simple implementation of an undirected graph:

```php
class Graph {
    protected $graph;
    protected $visited = [];

    public function __construct() {
        $this->graph = [];
    }

    public function addEdge($origin, $destination) {
        $this->graph[$origin][] = $destination;
        $this->graph[$destination][] = $origin;
    }

    public function getGraph() {
        return $this->graph;
    }
}

$graph = new Graph();
$graph->addEdge('A', 'B');
$graph->addEdge('A', 'C');
$graph->addEdge('B', 'C');

print_r($graph->getGraph());
```

This will print:

```
Array
(
    [A] => Array
        (
            [0] => B
            [1] => C
        )

    [B] => Array
        (
            [0] => A
            [1] => C
        )

    [C] => Array
        (
            [0] => A
            [1] => B
        )
)
```

This represents a graph where A is connected to B and C, and B and C are also connected.

Please note these are very basic representations of these data structures, in real-world applications, you might need more complex and optimized structures. For example, you might want to add methods for adding nodes or edges, checking connectivity, finding paths, and so on.
