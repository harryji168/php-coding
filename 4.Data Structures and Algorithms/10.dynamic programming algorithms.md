Dynamic programming is a powerful method in computer science for optimizing certain types of performance problems. It involves breaking down a problem into simpler, overlapping sub-problems, following the principle of optimality, and storing the solutions to these sub-problems to avoid redundant work.

The classic examples of dynamic programming are problems like the Fibonacci sequence, the knapsack problem, or the coin change problem.

Here, I'll explain and provide a PHP code example of the Fibonacci sequence problem using dynamic programming.

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers form a sequence such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is, the sequence starts 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...

Here is the dynamic programming approach to finding the nth Fibonacci number in PHP:

```php
<?php
function fibonacci($n)
{
    // create an array of size n+1 to store the calculated Fibonacci numbers
    $fib = array_fill(0, $n+1, 0);

    // base case initialization
    $fib[1] = 1;

    // iterate from 2 to n, and fill in each Fibonacci number
    for ($i = 2; $i <= $n; $i++) {
        $fib[$i] = $fib[$i-1] + $fib[$i-2];
    }

    // finally return nth Fibonacci number
    return $fib[$n];
}

echo fibonacci(10);  // Output: 55
?>
```

This function calculates the nth Fibonacci number in O(n) time and O(n) space, which is a significant improvement over the naive recursive solution that takes O(2^n) time.

You could also optimize the space complexity to O(1) by only keeping track of the last two Fibonacci numbers:

```php
<?php
function fibonacci($n)
{
    if ($n <= 1) {
        return $n;
    }

    $prev = 0;
    $curr = 1;

    for ($i = 2; $i <= $n; $i++) {
        $new = $prev + $curr;
        $prev = $curr;
        $curr = $new;
    }

    return $curr;
}

echo fibonacci(10);  // Output: 55
?>
```

Here, we are using the bottom-up approach to dynamic programming, where we first solve smaller sub-problems and use their solutions to solve larger sub-problems.
