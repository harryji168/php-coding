Sure, here's a more detailed explanation along with a basic example:

1. **UTF-8 without BOM:** When you save a file in an editor (like Notepad++, Sublime Text, VSCode, etc.), you need to ensure it's saved with UTF-8 encoding. BOM (Byte Order Mark) is a special kind of signature that indicates the encoding and endianness of a text file. However, it can cause problems in PHP, such as unexpected output or headers already sent errors. So, it's recommended to save PHP files as "UTF-8 without BOM" if such an option is available in your editor.

2. **Files should end with ".php":** This simply means that when you save your file, you should save it with a ".php" extension. This is how the server knows that it should interpret the file with the PHP interpreter.

3. **No non-PHP code after the closing PHP tag:** PHP tags are opened with `<?php` and closed with `?>`. It's recommended to omit the closing tag at the end of a file. This is because any whitespace or new lines after the closing tag can cause PHP to output these before HTTP headers are sent, causing errors like "headers already sent".

Here's an example of a well-formatted PHP file according to these rules:

```php
<?php
// File saved as "sample.php", encoded as "UTF-8 without BOM"

// Declare a variable and assign a string value
$greeting = "Hello, Moodle!";

// Define a function to display the greeting
function display_greeting($greeting) {
    echo $greeting;
}

// Call the function
display_greeting($greeting);

// Note: No closing PHP tag here
```

In this file, we've followed the guidelines: the file is saved with a ".php" extension, encoded in UTF-8 without BOM, and doesn't contain a closing PHP tag or any non-PHP code after it.
