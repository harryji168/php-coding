In PHP, there are multiple ways to denote the start and end of PHP code blocks. The full PHP tags `<?php` and `?>` are always recognized and accepted, while the short open tags `<?` and `?>` are not always recognized, depending on the server configuration.

Using full PHP tags makes your code more portable across different server configurations. This is why Moodle's coding guidelines instruct you to use full PHP tags.

A simple example is as follows:

**Correct:**

```php
<?php

echo "Hello, world!";

?>
```

**Incorrect:**

```php
<?

echo "Hello, world!";

?>
```

In the correct example, we use `<?php` to start the PHP block and `?>` to end it. This code will be correctly interpreted by any PHP interpreter.

In the incorrect example, we use `<?` to start the PHP block. This code may not be correctly interpreted on all servers, particularly if the short_open_tag configuration option is disabled.

When working with Moodle or other PHP code bases, it's always recommended to follow the given coding guidelines, which usually include using full PHP tags, for the sake of code compatibility and consistency.
