For boolean variables, Moodle follows the same convention as other variable types, using all lowercase letters and separating words with underscores. 

However, to make it clear that a variable is a boolean, a common practice is to start the variable name with "is", "has", "can" or similar verbs. This makes it clear that the variable is a flag that can be either `true` or `false`. 

Here are some examples:

```php
$is_active = true;
$has_access = false;
$can_edit = true;
```

In the above examples, `$is_active` might be used to indicate whether a user account is active, `$has_access` could indicate whether a user has access to a certain resource, and `$can_edit` might indicate whether a user has the necessary permissions to edit a resource.

This naming convention gives an immediate clue as to the type of the variable and the kind of values it will hold, making the code easier to understand. 

Remember, however, that these are general naming conventions, and the actual variable names should accurately reflect their specific use within your code.
