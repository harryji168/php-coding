Sure, here are the coding style guidelines for Class and Function names in Moodle:

**Class Names:**
In Moodle, the naming convention for classes is StudlyCaps (also known as PascalCase), where each word starts with a capital letter and there are no underscores between words. Class names should be descriptive and specific to what the class does. Also, class file names should be the same as the class name.

Here's an example:

```php
// If you have a class that handles user profiles, the class name could be:
class UserProfileHandler {
    // Your code here
}
```

Class names in Moodle often have a prefix that relates to the plugin or core subsystem, so in practice, they might look like this:

```php
class mod_forum_observer {
    // Your code here
}
```

**Function Names:**
For function names, Moodle follows a lower-case-with-underscores naming convention (also known as snake_case). The function name should also be descriptive and give a clear indication of what the function does. 

Here's an example:

```php
// If you have a function that calculates a user's total score, it might be named:
function calculate_total_score() {
    // Your code here
}
```

In the case of methods inside classes, you'll often see a combination of class and function naming conventions:

```php
class mod_forum_observer {
    public static function user_enrolled(...) {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```

As always, be sure to check the latest Moodle documentation as standards can evolve.
