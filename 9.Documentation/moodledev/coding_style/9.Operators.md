Binary operators are those that require two operands. In PHP, common binary operators include arithmetic operators (like +, -, *, /, %), assignment operators (like =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=), comparison operators (like ==, !=, <>, ===, !==, <, >, <=, >=), and logical operators (like and, or, xor).

In Moodle's coding style, most binary operators should be separated from their operands by spaces. This includes the operators mentioned above.

Here are some examples:

```php
// Arithmetic operators
$sum = $a + $b; 
$difference = $a - $b;
$product = $a * $b;
$quotient = $a / $b;
$remainder = $a % $b;

// Assignment operators
$total += $a; // same as $total = $total + $a
$total -= $b; // same as $total = $total - $b

// Comparison operators
if ($a == $b) {
    //...
}
if ($c != $d) {
    //...
}
if ($e <= $f) {
    //...
}

// Logical operators
if ($a == $b and $c != $d) {
    //...
}
if ($e <= $f or $g > $h) {
    //...
}
```

These examples follow Moodle's coding style where binary operators are separated by spaces. This makes the code easier to read, which is a key goal of having a coding style guide.

## Exception to the rule: The unary increment/decrement operators (like ++, --) and the error control operator (@) are not separated by spaces. For instance:

```php
$count++;
$error = @file_get_contents($file);
```

Always remember to refer to Moodle's latest coding style guide to ensure your code adheres to their current standards.
