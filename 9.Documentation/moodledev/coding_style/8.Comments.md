PHPDoc is a documentation format used in the PHP programming language, which provides a nice and easy way to document your PHP classes, methods, and functions. Here is a more detailed description of the PHPDoc format along with some examples.

1. **Class comments:** Comment blocks for classes should contain a brief description of the class and its functionality. Here is an example:

```php
/**
 * The Student class represents a student in the system.
 *
 * This class provides all the methods required to manage students, including
 * adding a new student, updating student details, and retrieving student details.
 */
class Student {
    // class content
}
```

2. **Method comments:** Comments for methods should describe what the method does, its parameters, and its return value. If the method can throw exceptions, they should be documented as well. Here is an example:

```php
/**
 * Calculates the grade for a student for a particular course.
 *
 * @param int $studentId The ID of the student.
 * @param int $courseId The ID of the course.
 * @return float The grade of the student for the course.
 * @throws InvalidArgumentException If $studentId or $courseId is not a positive integer.
 */
public function calculateGrade($studentId, $courseId) {
    // method content
}
```

3. **Property comments:** Comments for properties (variables) should include a data type and a brief description of what the property represents. Here is an example:

```php
/**
 * @var int The ID of the student.
 */
private $studentId;
```

Keep in mind, that above examples are quite generic, the specifics might vary from one project to another. For Moodle, it is best to follow their specific guidelines and look at how the existing codebase is documented.

It is also useful to use a code editor or an IDE that understands the PHPDoc format, as it can show the documentation in tooltips when you hover over the method or class name in the code. Examples of such editors/IDEs are Visual Studio Code, PhpStorm, or Sublime Text with appropriate plugins.
