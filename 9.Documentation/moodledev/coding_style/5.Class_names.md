in Moodle, class names should be given in StudlyCaps (also known as PascalCase). This means that the first letter of the class name and the first letter of each subsequent concatenated word are capitalized. Here is a simple rule and example:

**Rule:**
Class names should be capitalized words without underscores, and should be relevant and descriptive of the purpose of the class. 

**Example:**
If you're creating a class for managing user sessions, you might name it `UserSessionManager`.

```php
class UserSessionManager {
    // Class code goes here.
}
```

**Namespaces:**
Moodle 2.6 and later support namespaces, which should also follow the StudlyCaps naming convention. Namespaces should be defined at the very top of your PHP file, even before any require_once() statements.

For example, if you're creating a component named 'mod_mymodule' in a local plugin, your namespace might look like:

```php
namespace local_mymodule\mod_mymodule;

class UserSessionManager {
    // Class code goes here.
}
```

Remember, following the StudlyCaps convention allows for easier readability and understanding of the code. It's important to note that while these conventions were accurate as of September 2021, Moodle's standards may change over time. Always check the most current guidelines from Moodle's official website.
