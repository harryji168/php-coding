Moodle's variable naming conventions and provide some examples:

Moodle follows the lower-case-with-underscores naming convention for variables, often referred to as "snake_case". This involves using all lowercase letters for the variable name, and if the name comprises multiple words, they should be separated by underscores (_).

For instance, if you want to declare a variable to store the number of courses, it should look like this:

```php
$num_courses = 10;
```

If you have a variable storing the user's first name, it should be:

```php
$user_first_name = "John";
```

While these naming conventions can make variable names a bit long, they also make the code more readable by clearly describing what each variable is used for. For example, someone reading your code will instantly know that `$user_first_name` is a variable holding the user's first name.

There are exceptions to this rule for iterators and counters within loops, where it's generally acceptable to use variables like `$i`, `$j`, `$k` etc. These are recognized as standard loop variables, but should only be used for simple incrementing counters. For example:

```php
for ($i = 0; $i < $num_courses; $i++) {
    // Your code here
}
```

Remember, the key is that variable names should be as descriptive as necessary, so that someone else reading your code (or you, when you come back to it after some time) can understand what's happening. In other words, strive for clarity and readability in your variable names.
