In Moodle, function names should be descriptive, lowercased, and words should be separated by underscores. 

For example, if you're creating a function that calculates the average of a set of grades for a student, you could name the function like this:

```php
function calculate_student_average($grades) {
    // Your code here...
}
```

Another example, if you're writing a function to print a list of courses:

```php
function print_course_list($courses) {
    // Your code here...
}
```

In both examples, the function names are fully lowercase and use underscores to separate words, making them easier to read and understand.

If a function is part of a class (thus a method), the naming convention is similar. However, the visibility of the method (public, protected, or private) should also be declared. For example:

```php
class course {
    public function get_course_list() {
        // Your code here...
    }
}
```

Note that, as of PHP 7.0, you can also specify the return type of a function:

```php
function calculate_student_average($grades): float {
    // Your code here...
}
```

In this example, the `: float` after the function declaration indicates that this function will return a float value. This is called type hinting and it's part of PHP 7.0 and later. Type hinting can make your code more robust and less prone to errors, and it's considered good practice to use it where appropriate.
