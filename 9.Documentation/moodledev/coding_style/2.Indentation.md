 when Moodle mentions the use of spaces for indentation, they're essentially talking about the formatting of your code. Indentation helps to visually separate different blocks of code, making it easier to read and understand. 

In Moodle's coding style guide, they recommend using 4 spaces for each level of indentation. That means for each new block of code (e.g., functions, loops, conditionals, etc.), you should indent your code by 4 additional spaces. Note that you should use actual space characters, not the tab character. This is because the size of a tab character can vary between different editors, but a space is always a single character.

Here is an example:

```php
<?php
// This is a correctly indented block of code in Moodle

function calculate_grade($student_id, $course_id) {
    $grades = fetch_grades($student_id, $course_id);
    
    if (empty($grades)) {
        return false;
    }
    
    $total = 0;
    
    foreach ($grades as $grade) {
        $total += $grade;
    }
    
    $average = $total / count($grades);
    
    return $average;
}
?>
```

In this example, the function `calculate_grade` is defined at the base indentation level. Inside this function, every subsequent block of code (the `if` condition, the `foreach` loop) is indented by 4 additional spaces. This helps to visually indicate that these blocks of code are "inside" the function. Inside the `if` statement and the `foreach` loop, the inner code is further indented by 4 more spaces.
