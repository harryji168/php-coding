The line length recommendation is a guideline rather than a strict rule. Its purpose is to enhance code readability. When code is too wide to fit into an editor window, it requires the reader to scroll horizontally, which can be a hindrance to understanding the code. 

Here's an example that illustrates the idea:

Without line length limit:
```php
$veryLongVariableName = 'This is a long string that represents some data we have received from an external source and we want to process it within our Moodle PHP script which will make it really long and difficult to read in a standard text editor without horizontal scrolling.';
```

With line length limit:
```php
$veryLongVariableName = 'This is a long string that represents some data we have received from '
    . 'an external source and we want to process it within our Moodle PHP script which will make '
    . 'it really long and difficult to read in a standard text editor without horizontal scrolling.';
```

In the second example, the string is broken down into several concatenated strings to keep the line length within a reasonable limit.

However, in some cases, it might not be possible or beneficial to keep the line length under the recommended 132 characters, such as in the case of a long URL or a complex regular expression. This is why it's referred to as a "soft limit". It should be adhered to where practical, but readability and understandability of the code are more important.
