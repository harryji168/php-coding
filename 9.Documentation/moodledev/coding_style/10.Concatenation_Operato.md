In Moodle's coding style, when you're concatenating (joining) strings together using the concatenation operator (a period or dot .), you should include a space on either side of the dot.

Here's a simple example:

**Correct:**

```php
$welcome_message = "Hello, " . $username . "! Welcome to Moodle.";
```

**Incorrect:**

```php
$welcome_message = "Hello,".$username."! Welcome to Moodle.";
```

In the correct example, there is a space on either side of the concatenation operator (the dot .), following Moodle's coding style guidelines.

These coding style guidelines are in place to make the code easier to read and maintain. It might seem like a small detail, but when you're working on large projects with many contributors, following the same style can make a big difference in productivity and bug prevention.
