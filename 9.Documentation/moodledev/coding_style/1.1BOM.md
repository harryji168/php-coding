The Byte Order Mark (BOM) is a Unicode character used to signal the endianness (byte order) of a text. It's a mechanism to indicate whether the text is encoded in little-endian or big-endian format. BOM is used in UTF-16 and UTF-32 to indicate which byte order is used, and by default, in UTF-8 as well.

It is not required in UTF-8, but its presence at the start of a file can help software correctly identify the file as being in UTF-8 format.

Here's what the BOM looks like in hexadecimal form for different encodings:

- UTF-8: EF BB BF
- UTF-16 (big endian): FE FF
- UTF-16 (little endian): FF FE
- UTF-32 (big endian): 00 00 FE FF
- UTF-32 (little endian): FF FE 00 00

These codes are actually the Unicode character 'ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE' (U+FEFF) written in the encoding.

Let's take an example of a text file with BOM. If you open a text file in a hex editor, it might look something like this:

- With UTF-8 BOM:
  EF BB BF 48 65 6C 6C 6F 20 57 6F 72 6C 64
  In this case, "EF BB BF" is the BOM, and the rest ("48 65 6C 6C 6F 20 57 6F 72 6C 64") is the ASCII encoding for "Hello World".

- Without BOM:
  48 65 6C 6C 6F 20 57 6F 72 6C 64
  Here, the text "Hello World" is directly encoded in ASCII.

Remember that the BOM should be invisible to the user when the text is displayed by a viewer that recognizes the BOM. If it's not recognized, it may show up as an unexpected or strange character.
