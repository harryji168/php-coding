The control structures, as per Moodle's coding style guidelines, follow the basic layout of the Pear coding style. Here are more specific details for each control structure:

1. **If, Elseif, Else:**
    - There should be a space between the if/elseif/else keyword and the opening parenthesis.
    - The opening brace should go on the same line as the keyword.
    - The closing brace should go on a new line after the body.
    - An else or elseif should be on the same line as the preceding closing brace.

```php
if ($condition_one) {
    // code here
} elseif ($condition_two) {
    // code here
} else {
    // code here
}
```

2. **For, Foreach:**
    - Similar to if structures, there should be a space between the for/foreach keyword and the opening parenthesis.
    - The opening brace should go on the same line as the keyword, and the closing brace should go on a new line after the body.

```php
for ($i = 0; $i < $count; $i++) {
    // code here
}

foreach ($items as $item) {
    // code here
}
```

3. **While:**
    - Similar to if and for structures, there should be a space between the while keyword and the opening parenthesis.
    - The opening brace should go on the same line as the keyword, and the closing brace should go on a new line after the body.

```php
while ($condition) {
    // code here
}
```

4. **Switch:**
    - A space is required between the switch keyword and the opening parenthesis.
    - The opening brace should go on the same line as the keyword.
    - Case and default statements should be indented one level under the switch.
    - Break statements should be indented at the same level as case and default.
    - The closing brace should go on a new line after the body.

```php
switch ($condition) {
    case 1:
        // code here
        break;

    case 2:
        // code here
        break;

    default:
        // code here
        break;
}
```

Remember that all code inside these control structures should be indented one level (4 spaces) from the structure itself. It helps to make the code clear and readable.
