**Question:** Consider the following PHP code used in a Moodle plugin. Can you spot any violation of Moodle's coding style guidelines?

```php
<?php
class StudentDetails {
    public function GetFullName($first_name, $last_name){
        $full_name = $first_name . $last_name;
        return $full_name;
    }
}
?>
```

**Answer:**

1. The function name `GetFullName` is not in accordance with Moodle's naming convention. Function names should be in lowercase with words separated by underscores. It should be `get_full_name`.

2. There should be a space before the opening brace `{` of the function definition.

3. The binary operator `.` for concatenation should be surrounded by spaces.

The corrected code following Moodle's coding style guidelines would be:

```php
<?php
class StudentDetails {
    public function get_full_name($first_name, $last_name) {
        $full_name = $first_name . ' ' . $last_name;
        return $full_name;
    }
}
?>
```

This question tests the understanding of Moodle's coding style guidelines, particularly the naming conventions for functions, spacing around operators, and braces.


Certainly, let's dive into more complex Moodle coding style questions:

**Question 1:** 

You're given the following PHP function for a Moodle plugin. There are several coding style issues in this code. Identify and fix them.

```php
<?php
function getcoursemodules($course_id)
{
    global $DB;
    $modules = $DB->get_records('course_modules', array('course' => $course_id,));
    return $modules;
}
?>
```

**Answer 1:**

1. There should not be a comma after the last element in an array.
2. The opening brace `{` should be on the same line as the function declaration.
3. According to Moodle's guidelines, there should be a space on both sides of the `=>` operator in the array.

The corrected code is:

```php
<?php
function get_course_modules($course_id) {
    global $DB;
    $modules = $DB->get_records('course_modules', array('course' => $course_id));
    return $modules;
}
?>
```

**Question 2:**

Consider the following piece of code which is a part of a Moodle plugin. Identify and correct the violations of Moodle's coding style guidelines.

```php
<?php
function processgrades($course_id,$grades){
global $DB;

$transaction = $DB->start_delegated_transaction();
foreach($grades as $grade){
    $DB->insert_record('grades', array('course' => $course_id, 'grade' => $grade,));
}
$transaction->allow_commit();
}
?>
```

**Answer 2:**

1. There should be a space after the comma in the function parameters.
2. The opening brace `{` should be on the same line as the function declaration.
3. According to Moodle's guidelines, there should be a space on both sides of the `=>` operator in the array.
4. There should not be a comma after the last element in an array.
5. There should be a space after `foreach`.
6. There should be a space before the opening and after the closing parenthesis of the `foreach`.

The corrected code is:

```php
<?php
function process_grades($course_id, $grades) {
    global $DB;

    $transaction = $DB->start_delegated_transaction();
    foreach ($grades as $grade) {
        $DB->insert_record('grades', array('course' => $course_id, 'grade' => $grade));
    }
    $transaction->allow_commit();
}
?>
```
