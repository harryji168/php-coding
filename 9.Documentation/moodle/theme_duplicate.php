Duplicating and modifying a theme in Moodle allows you to create a custom theme based on an existing theme. Here's how to do it:

1. **Duplicate the theme directory**: Find the directory of the theme you want to duplicate in the Moodle `theme` directory. For example, if you're duplicating the `clean` theme, you would look for `theme/clean`. Copy this directory and give it a new name. For example, you might name it `theme/mytheme`.

2. **Rename the theme in `config.php`**: In your new theme directory, find the `config.php` file. Open it, and change the `$THEME->name` value to the name of your new theme. For example:

    ```php
    $THEME->name = 'mytheme';
    ```

3. **Update `version.php`**: In the `version.php` file of your new theme directory, update the `$plugin->component` value to 'theme_yourtheme'. For example:

    ```php
    $plugin->component = 'theme_mytheme';
    ```

   Also update the version number to the current date. For example:

    ```php
    $plugin->version = 2023071600;
    ```

4. **Rename language strings**: In your new theme directory, find the `lang` directory. Inside this directory, you should see another directory for each language your theme supports (such as `en` for English). Inside each language directory, you'll find a `.php` file with the same name as the original theme. Rename this file to match the name of your new theme.

    Inside this file, update the language strings to reflect the new theme name. For example:

    ```php
    $string['pluginname'] = 'My theme';
    $string['choosereadme'] = 'My theme is a Moodle theme based on the Clean theme.';
    ```

5. **Customize your theme**: Now you're ready to start customizing your theme. You can modify the CSS files, PHP layout files, images, and other assets as needed. Be sure to clear Moodle's caches (from the Moodle admin menu, go to `Site administration > Development > Purge all caches`) to see your changes take effect.

6. **Install your theme**: To install your theme, visit the Site administration > Notifications page in your Moodle site. Moodle will automatically detect the new theme and install it.

Remember, always back up your Moodle site before making significant changes, and test all changes thoroughly before deploying them to a live site.
