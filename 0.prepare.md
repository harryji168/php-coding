 practicing PHP coding, understanding PHP theory, and familiarizing yourself with the problem-solving process commonly used in coding. Here are some steps you can follow to prepare:

1. **Brush Up on Your PHP Skills:** Review the basic syntax, variables, operators, conditionals, loops, arrays, strings, functions, sessions, cookies, and form handling. You should also learn about more advanced topics like object-oriented programming, error handling, PHP and MySQL, and file handling.

2. **Code Everyday:** Coding is a practical skill, and the more you do it, the better you'll get. Try to spend at least an hour or two each day working on PHP code. This will help you understand the language's quirks and build your problem-solving skills.

3. **Practice Problem Solving:** Most coding tests involve solving some sort of problem, so it's important to develop your problem-solving skills. Websites like HackerRank, LeetCode, and Codewars offer programming problems that you can practice on. Some of these websites even have PHP-specific problems.

4. **Study Data Structures and Algorithms:** Although PHP is often used for web development, coding tests might still cover data structures and algorithms, as these are fundamental to computer science. Make sure you understand arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, as well as algorithms like sorting and searching.

5. **Learn to Write Clean Code:** In a test environment, it's not just about whether your code works, it's also about how clean and understandable it is. Follow best practices for naming variables and functions, organizing code, and adding comments.

6. **Familiarize Yourself With PHP's Built-in Functions:** PHP has a number of built-in functions that can make your code more efficient. Familiarize yourself with functions for manipulating arrays and strings, handling dates and times, and more.

7. **Understand Databases:** Most PHP applications interact with a database in some way, so understanding SQL and how PHP interacts with databases is important.

8. **Mock Tests:** Before the actual test, give yourself a mock test. Pick a problem, set a timer, and see how you do. This will help you get a feel for the pressure of the actual test.

9. **Read Documentation:** Understanding how to read and use PHP documentation can be very helpful, as it is a common resource for solving problems and learning more about the language.

10. **Relax and Get a Good Night's Sleep:** Before the test, make sure to relax and get a good night's sleep. You'll perform better if you're well-rested and not stressed out.

Remember, the goal of a coding test is not just to see whether you can code, but also to see how you think and solve problems. Good luck!
