PHP provides many built-in functions for handling dates and times. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:

https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.datetime.php


- `date()`: Formats a local date and time.
- `time()`: Returns the current time as a Unix timestamp (the number of seconds since January 1 1970 00:00:00 GMT).
- `strtotime()`: Converts a string representation of a date and time to a Unix timestamp.
- `mktime()`: Gets the Unix timestamp for a date.
- `date_diff()`: Returns the difference between two DateTime objects.

Here is a simple example of how to use these functions:

```php
<?php

// Get the current date/time
echo date('Y-m-d H:i:s') . "\n"; // output format: 2023-07-15 14:20:30

// Get the Unix timestamp for the current time
$currentTimestamp = time();
echo $currentTimestamp . "\n";

// Convert a string to a timestamp
$str = '2023-12-01 12:00:00';
$timestamp = strtotime($str);
echo $timestamp . "\n";

// Convert a timestamp back to a readable date/time
echo date('Y-m-d H:i:s', $timestamp) . "\n";

// Get the Unix timestamp for a specific date/time
$timestamp2 = mktime(12, 0, 0, 12, 1, 2023); // hour, minute, second, month, day, year
echo $timestamp2 . "\n";

// Calculate the difference between two dates
$date1 = date_create('2023-12-01');
$date2 = date_create('2024-01-01');
$diff = date_diff($date1, $date2);
echo $diff->format('%R%a days') . "\n"; // output format: +31 days

?>
```

In the above example, the `date()` function is used to format the current date and time in a specific format. The `time()` function is used to get the current time as a Unix timestamp. The `strtotime()` function is used to convert a string representation of a date and time to a Unix timestamp, and then the `date()` function is used again to convert it back to a readable date/time. The `mktime()` function is used to get the Unix timestamp for a specific date/time. Finally, the `date_diff()` function is used to calculate the difference between two dates.
