PHP has numerous built-in functions that can help you write more efficient and shorter code. Here, I'll show you a few of these functions, specifically in the areas of array and string manipulation, and date and time handling.

**1. Array functions**

PHP provides several functions for manipulating arrays:

- `count($array)`: Counts all elements in an array.

- `array_push($array, $value1, $value2, ...)`: Pushes one or more elements onto the end of an array.

- `array_pop($array)`: Pops and returns the last value of the array, shortening the array by one element.

- `sort($array)`: Sorts an array in ascending order.

- `array_merge($array1, $array2, ...)`: Merges one or more arrays.

Example:

```php
<?php
$array1 = array("color" => "red", 2, 4);
$array2 = array("a", "b", "color" => "green", "shape" => "trapezoid", 4);
$result = array_merge($array1, $array2);
print_r($result);
?>
```

**2. String functions**

We've already talked about string functions in the previous post, but here are a few more examples:

- `trim($string)`: Strips whitespace from the beginning and end of a string.

- `str_split($string)`: Converts a string into an array.

- `implode($glue, $array)`: Joins array elements with a string.

Example:

```php
<?php
$array = array('lastname', 'email', 'phone');
$comma_separated = implode(",", $array);

echo $comma_separated;
?>
```

**3. Date and time functions**

PHP also offers functions to handle dates and times:

- `date($format, $timestamp)`: Formats a local date and time.

- `time()`: Returns the current time as a Unix timestamp.

- `strtotime($time, $now)`: Parses a time string and returns a Unix timestamp.

Example:

```php
<?php
echo 'Current time: ' . date('Y-m-d H:i:s', time()) . "\n";

// Calculate the timestamp of '2 days ago'
$timestamp = strtotime('-2 days');
echo 'Time of 2 days ago: ' . date('Y-m-d H:i:s', $timestamp) . "\n";
?>
```

Knowing about these functions and how to use them can greatly improve your PHP coding efficiency.
