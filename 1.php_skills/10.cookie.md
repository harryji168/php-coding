Cookies are small files that are stored on the user's computer. They are designed to hold a modest amount of data specific to a particular client and website and can be accessed either by the web server or the client computer.

In PHP, cookies can be created using the `setcookie()` function. This function must appear BEFORE the HTML tag. Once the cookies have been set, they can be accessed on subsequent pages using the `$_COOKIE` superglobal.

Here's an example of how to create and retrieve a cookie in PHP:

```php
<?php
// Set a cookie
setcookie("favorite_color", "blue", time() + (86400 * 30), "/"); // 86400 = 1 day

// Check if the cookie is set
if(isset($_COOKIE["favorite_color"])) {
    echo "Favorite color is: " . $_COOKIE["favorite_color"];
} else {
    echo "No favorite color set.";
}
?>
```

In this example, a cookie named `favorite_color` is being set with the value `blue`. The `time() + (86400 * 30)` parameter specifies that the cookie should expire in one month (30 days). The `"/"` parameter means the cookie is available in the entire website (all paths).

The `isset($_COOKIE["favorite_color"])` condition checks whether a cookie with the name `favorite_color` is set.

Remember that cookies are part of the HTTP header, so `setcookie()` must be called before any output is sent to the browser. This is the same restriction as for the `header()` function. You'll get an error if you try to use `setcookie()` after the HTTP headers have been sent.
