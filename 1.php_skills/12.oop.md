**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code. Data in the form of fields, often known as attributes, and code in the form of procedures, are known as methods. An object is an instance of a class.

In PHP, OOP involves the following main concepts:

1. **Classes**: Classes are the blueprints for objects. A class defines the properties and methods that an object will have.

2. **Objects**: Objects are instances of a class. They are the individual instances that the class describes.

3. **Properties**: Properties are the characteristics of an object. These are often known as attributes or data members.

4. **Methods**: Methods are the actions that an object can perform. In simple terms, they are functions inside a class.

5. **Inheritance**: This is the process by which one class takes on the properties and methods of another class. PHP supports single inheritance, meaning that a class can inherit from one parent only.

6. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism is the ability of a function or object to take many forms. In PHP, polymorphism is achieved through interfaces and abstract classes.

7. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is the practice of hiding the details of an object's properties and methods, and only providing a specified way to interact with the object.

Here's a simple example that demonstrates some of these concepts:

```php
<?php
// A class
class Car {
    // properties
    public $color;
    public $manufacturer;

    // a method
    public function setColor($color) {
        $this->color = $color;
    }

    public function setManufacturer($manufacturer) {
        $this->manufacturer = $manufacturer;
    }

    public function getDetails() {
        return "This is a " . $this->color . " car made by " . $this->manufacturer . ".";
    }
}

// Creating an object
$myCar = new Car();

// Setting properties
$myCar->setColor('red');
$myCar->setManufacturer('Toyota');

// Getting details
echo $myCar->getDetails();  // Output: This is a red car made by Toyota.
?>
```

This example demonstrates a simple class `Car` with properties `color` and `manufacturer` and methods to set these properties and get the details. An object `$myCar` is created and its properties are set using the methods. The `getDetails()` method is then called to output the details of the car.
