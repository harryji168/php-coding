`FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL` is a constant in PHP used with the `filter_var()` function to validate if a given string is in a valid email format.

Here's a brief example of how it's used:

```php
$email = "user@example.com";
if (!filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {
    echo("Email is not valid");
} else {
    echo("Email is valid");
}
```

In this example, `filter_var()` checks if the string stored in the `$email` variable has a valid email format. If the format is not valid, it returns `false`, triggering the "Email is not valid" message. If the format is valid, it simply returns the email, so the else clause triggers and prints "Email is valid".

The `FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL` filter validates the email in the following way:

- It checks if the email address contains one @ symbol.
- It checks for a valid format on both sides of the @ symbol. The local part of the email (before the @ symbol) can contain alphabetical and numerical characters, and the following special characters: ., -, and _. The domain part (after the @ symbol) can contain alphabetical and numerical characters, and the - (dash) character, followed by a period (.) and a letter-based top-level domain (.com, .net, etc.).

It should be noted that this validation, as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, does not fully adhere to all of the complex rules set out by the RFC 5322 standard, which governs email address syntax. Therefore, it is possible that `FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL` may falsely report some valid addresses as invalid or vice versa. 

Even when using `FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL`, be sure to sanitize any user-submitted email addresses before using them in your application to prevent against security vulnerabilities. It's also always a good idea to verify the email address by sending a confirmation email to the user.
