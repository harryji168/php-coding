PHP is often used in combination with a MySQL database. PHP provides MySQLi and PDO (PHP Data Objects) to interact with MySQL.

Here's an example of how to connect to a MySQL database, insert data into a table, and fetch data from a table using MySQLi:

**1. Create a Connection:**

```php
<?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "username";
$password = "password";
$dbname = "database";

// Create connection
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
  die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
echo "Connected successfully";
?>
```

**2. Insert Data into a Table:**

```php
<?php
$sql = "INSERT INTO MyTable (firstname, lastname, email)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'john@example.com')";

if ($conn->query($sql) === TRUE) {
  echo "New record created successfully";
} else {
  echo "Error: " . $sql . "<br>" . $conn->error;
}
?>
```

**3. Fetch Data from a Table:**

```php
<?php
$sql = "SELECT id, firstname, lastname FROM MyTable";
$result = $conn->query($sql);

if ($result->num_rows > 0) {
  // output data of each row
  while($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
    echo "id: " . $row["id"]. " - Name: " . $row["firstname"]. " " . $row["lastname"]. "<br>";
  }
} else {
  echo "0 results";
}
$conn->close();
?>
```

Remember, in production code, you should not hardcode database credentials in your PHP files for security reasons. Also, user-supplied data should always be sanitized and parameterized before being used in SQL queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

The examples above are very basic. Depending on your specific needs, you might want to use more advanced features, like prepared statements, transactions, or calling stored procedures. The MySQLi and PDO libraries both provide these features.
