A session is a way to store information to be used across multiple pages. Unlike a cookie, the information is not stored on the users' computer. When a session is started following a request from a client to a server, a unique session ID is generated and sent to the client within a cookie. This session ID is sent by the client to the server in subsequent requests and is used by the server to retrieve the stored session data.

Here's a basic outline of how you might use sessions in PHP:

1. **Start a session**: The `session_start()` function must be the very first thing in your document before any HTML tags.

```php
<?php
// Starting session
session_start();
?>
```

2. **Storing Session Data**: The global PHP `$_SESSION` variable is used to store information about a session.

```php
<?php
// Starting session
session_start();

// Storing session data
$_SESSION["username"] = "John Doe";
$_SESSION["email"] = "john@example.com";
?>
```

3. **Accessing Session Data**: The PHP `$_SESSION` variable is used to access information about a session.

```php
<?php
// Starting session
session_start();

// Accessing session data
echo 'Hi, ' . $_SESSION["username"] . '.';
?>
```

This will output: "Hi, John Doe."

4. **Destroying Session**: The `session_destroy()` function is used to destroy all session data.

```php
<?php
// Starting session
session_start();

// Destroying session
session_destroy();
?>
```

It's important to note that session data is not permanent and will be deleted after the user has closed their browser or after the session has automatically timed out. You should therefore not rely on sessions to store information permanently.
