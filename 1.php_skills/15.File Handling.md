PHP has several functions to create, read, write, and close files. Here are some examples of how you can handle files in PHP:

1. **Opening a File: fopen()**
   
The `fopen()` function is used to open a file. It requires two arguments: the name of the file and the mode in which to open the file.

```php
$file = fopen("welcome.txt", "r");
```

Here, the "r" mode signifies read-only mode. There are several other modes you can use, like "w" for write (will also create a new file if it doesn't exist) and "a" for append.

2. **Reading from a File: fread(), fgets(), and fgetc()**

The `fread()` function is used to read from a file. It requires two arguments: a file pointer and the maximum length to read.

```php
$file = fopen("welcome.txt", "r");
$content = fread($file, filesize("welcome.txt"));
echo $content;
fclose($file);
```

The `fgets()` function is used to read a single line from a file:

```php
$file = fopen("welcome.txt", "r");
echo fgets($file);
fclose($file);
```

The `fgetc()` function is used to read a single character from a file:

```php
$file = fopen("welcome.txt", "r");
echo fgetc($file);
fclose($file);
```

3. **Writing to a File: fwrite()**

The `fwrite()` function is used to write to a file. It requires two arguments: a file pointer and a string of data to be written.

```php
$file = fopen("welcome.txt", "w");
fwrite($file, "Hello, World!");
fclose($file);
```

4. **Closing a File: fclose()**

The `fclose()` function is used to close an open file. It's a good practice to close all files after you have finished with them.

```php
$file = fopen("welcome.txt", "r");
fclose($file);
```

Remember to always handle potential errors when working with files. For instance, always check if the `fopen()` function was successful before trying to access the file. The `file_exists()` function can be used to check if a file exists before trying to open it.

```php
if(file_exists("welcome.txt")) {
    $file = fopen("welcome.txt", "r");
    // continue processing the file
} else {
    echo "The file does not exist.";
}
```

Remember, when a file is opened using fopen(), it should always be properly closed using fclose() after operations on it are complete. This helps to free up system resources.
