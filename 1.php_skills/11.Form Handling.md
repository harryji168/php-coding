Form handling is a fundamental part of web development. It is the process of capturing and processing user input from HTML forms. PHP, being a server-side scripting language, is commonly used to handle forms and interact with databases.

To create a simple form in HTML, you can use the following code:

```html
<form action="handle_form.php" method="post">
    <label for="name">Name:</label><br>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required><br>
    <label for="email">Email:</label><br>
    <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

In this form:

1. The `action` attribute points to the PHP file ("handle_form.php") that will process the form data.
2. The `method` attribute specifies how to send form-data (the form-data is sent as HTTP post transaction).
3. Each `input` element has an `id`, `name` and `type` attribute.

In the PHP file "handle_form.php", you can retrieve and use the form data like this:

```php
<?php
    // check if form data are submitted
    if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
        $name = $_POST["name"];
        $email = $_POST["email"];

        echo "Name: " . $name;
        echo "<br>";
        echo "Email: " . $email;
    }
?>
```

In this PHP code:

1. `$_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST"` checks whether the form is submitted using the POST method.
2. `$_POST["name"]` and `$_POST["email"]` retrieve the form data that the user entered into the "name" and "email" fields, respectively.

Please note that in a real-life application, you should sanitize and validate user inputs before using them to prevent security issues such as SQL injection and XSS attacks. PHP provides built-in functions for this purpose, such as `filter_var()` and `htmlspecialchars()`.
