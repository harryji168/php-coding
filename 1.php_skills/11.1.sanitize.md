Sanitizing and validating user inputs is a crucial part of building secure web applications. If unchecked, user inputs can lead to various types of security vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection and Cross-site Scripting (XSS). SQL Injection can lead to data theft, data loss, or unavailability of the data. XSS can be used to execute malicious scripts in the user's browser, which can lead to session hijacking, defacement of websites, or distribution of malware.

In PHP, there are several built-in functions that can be used to sanitize and validate inputs, such as `filter_var()` and `htmlspecialchars()`.

1. **filter_var():** This PHP function is used to validate and sanitize data. It takes two parameters: the data and the type of filter. 

For example, if you want to validate an email:
```php
$email = "example@example.com";
if (!filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {
  echo("Email is not valid");
} else {
  echo("Email is valid");
}
```
This code checks whether the `$email` is valid. If not, it returns a message that the email is not valid; otherwise, it returns that the email is valid.

In addition to validation, `filter_var()` can also sanitize input data. Here is an example of sanitizing a string by removing all HTML tags from it:
```php
$str = "<h1>Hello World!</h1>";
$new_str = filter_var($str, FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);
echo $new_str;
```
The output will be `Hello World!` as all HTML tags have been removed from the string.

2. **htmlspecialchars():** This PHP function is commonly used to prevent XSS attacks. It converts special characters to their HTML entities. So, for example, the character `<` would become `&lt;`, `>` would become `&gt;`, `"` would become `&quot;`, and so on.

Here's an example of how to use `htmlspecialchars()`:

```php
$str = "<h1>Hello World!</h1>";
$new_str = htmlspecialchars($str, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');
echo $new_str;
```

This will output `&lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;`. All special characters that could potentially be part of an HTML tag are converted to HTML entities, thus preventing any HTML from actually being rendered and executed by the browser.

Remember, these are only some of the many precautions that you should take to secure your application. Other practices involve using parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL Injection, setting appropriate HTTP headers to mitigate certain types of attacks, and using Content Security Policies to help prevent XSS attacks. 

Always ensure to follow the principle of least privilege and never trust user input without validation and sanitization. It's a good practice to keep up to date with the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) recommendations for securing your web applications.
