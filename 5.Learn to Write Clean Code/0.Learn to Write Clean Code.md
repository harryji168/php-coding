Writing clean code is an essential part of becoming a proficient programmer. Here are some key principles:

1. **Use meaningful and clear names:** Use names that reveal the intention of a function, variable, or class. For instance, a function that calculates the total price of items in a cart can be named `calculateTotalPrice()` rather than `calcTP()`. Variable names should also be clear, such as `numberOfItems` instead of `n`.

2. **Write functions that do one thing:** Functions should be small and perform one task. This makes them easier to understand, test, and reuse. If you find a function doing multiple things, try to split it into smaller functions.

3. **Avoid writing deeply nested code:** Deeply nested loops or conditional statements can make your code harder to read and understand. Try to keep your code as flat as possible.

4. **Use comments judiciously:** Comments are necessary but are not a substitute for poor naming or complex logic. Code should ideally be self-documenting. Use comments to explain why you wrote the code a certain way, not what it does.

5. **Adhere to the DRY principle:** DRY stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself". If you find yourself writing the same code in several places, consider creating a function or class that encapsulates that functionality.

6. **Formatting and organization:** Consistent indentation and spacing make your code more readable. Group related functions and methods together. Use a coding standard to maintain consistency, especially when working in a team.

7. **Error handling:** Anticipate and handle potential errors gracefully. Use exceptions or return statements to handle errors instead of ignoring them.

8. **Code reviews:** Have others review your code. They can provide valuable feedback and catch mistakes you may have missed.

Here's an example of clean code in PHP:

```php
<?php

// This function calculates the total price of items in a cart
function calculateTotalPrice($items) {
    $totalPrice = 0;

    foreach($items as $item) {
        $totalPrice += $item->price * $item->quantity;
    }

    return $totalPrice;
}

$items = [
    (object) ["price" => 10, "quantity" => 2],
    (object) ["price" => 20, "quantity" => 1],
    (object) ["price" => 5, "quantity" => 5],
];

$totalPrice = calculateTotalPrice($items);

echo "Total price: $totalPrice\n";

?>
```

This code is easy to read and understand, and each function does one specific thing. The variable names are clear, and there's a comment explaining what the function does.
