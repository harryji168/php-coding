Writing functions that do one thing promotes modularity, readability, reusability, and easier testing. This principle comes from the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) which is one of the five principles from SOLID. It suggests that a function should have only one reason to change. This makes your code cleaner, easier to understand, and maintain.

Let's illustrate this with an example. Suppose you have a function that retrieves user data from a database and displays it.

```php
function getUserAndDisplay($userId) {
    // Connect to the database
    $db = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=test', 'username', 'password');

    // Fetch the user data
    $stmt = $db->prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :id');
    $stmt->execute(['id' => $userId]);
    $user = $stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_OBJ);

    // Display the user data
    echo 'Name: ' . $user->name . '<br>';
    echo 'Email: ' . $user->email . '<br>';
    echo 'Age: ' . $user->age . '<br>';
}
```

The `getUserAndDisplay()` function is doing multiple things: connecting to the database, retrieving user data, and displaying that data. If we want to change the way we display the data or fetch the data, we have to change this function. Also, if there is an error, it's harder to pinpoint where it came from. 

This function can be refactored into smaller functions each doing one thing:

```php
// This function retrieves a user from the database
function getUserFromDatabase($userId) {
    $db = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=test', 'username', 'password');

    $stmt = $db->prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :id');
    $stmt->execute(['id' => $userId]);
    return $stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_OBJ);
}

// This function displays a user
function displayUser($user) {
    echo 'Name: ' . $user->name . '<br>';
    echo 'Email: ' . $user->email . '<br>';
    echo 'Age: ' . $user->age . '<br>';
}

$user = getUserFromDatabase(1);
displayUser($user);
```

Now each function does only one thing: `getUserFromDatabase()` only retrieves a user from the database, and `displayUser()` only displays a user. If you need to change how data is fetched or displayed, you only need to modify one function. It's also easier to test each function separately. This is an example of how adhering to the principle of "each function should do one thing" can make your code cleaner and easier to maintain.
