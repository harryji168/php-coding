here are some detailed tips on naming conventions:

1. **Descriptive and Concise**: The name should describe what the variable, function, or class represents. It should be concise without being vague. `userAge` is more meaningful than `age`, and `calculateNetSalary()` is better than `calcSal()`. Avoid overly complex names or acronyms that are not universally recognized.

2. **Use Full Words**: Avoid abbreviations unless they are universally accepted, such as `Id` for Identifier or `Num` for Number. For example, `calculateTotalPrice()` is better than `calcTotPrc()`.

3. **Case Style**: Different languages have different conventions for case style. PHP typically uses camelCase for variables and functions (`$totalPrice`, `calculateTotalPrice()`) and PascalCase for classes (`ProductItem`).

4. **Start Boolean Variables With 'is', 'has', 'can', etc.**: If a variable is a boolean, its name should imply a true or false answer. `isActive`, `hasLicense`, `canEdit` are good boolean variable names.

5. **Function Names Should Indicate What They Do**: Function names should typically be verb phrases that indicate what the function does, such as `getUserName()`, `calculateTotal()`, `printReport()`.

6. **Classes and Objects**: Class names should typically be nouns. For example, if you have a class that represents a user in a system, a good name for the class could be `User`.

7. **Avoid Disinformation**: Do not use names that could be misinterpreted. For example, do not use the lowercase letter 'O' or the uppercase letter 'I' as variable names, as they could be confused with the numbers '0' and '1'.

8. **Consistency is Key**: Consistency makes your code easier to read. If you have decided to name your variables in camelCase, stick to it throughout your code. Consistency applies to your overall project and the team you are working with.

Remember, the goal is to write code that is self-explanatory, leading to fewer comments and easier maintenance and collaboration.
