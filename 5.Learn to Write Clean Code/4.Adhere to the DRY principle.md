The DRY principle, standing for "Don't Repeat Yourself", is a fundamental concept in software development. It suggests that duplication in logic or function is wasteful and should be eliminated through abstractions or by reusing code.

Here's a simple PHP code snippet that doesn't follow the DRY principle:

```php
<?php
function printUserDetails($user) {
    echo "Name: " . $user->name . "\n";
    echo "Email: " . $user->email . "\n";
}

$user1 = (object) ["name" => "Alice", "email" => "alice@example.com"];
echo "User 1 details:\n";
echo "----------------\n";
printUserDetails($user1);

$user2 = (object) ["name" => "Bob", "email" => "bob@example.com"];
echo "User 2 details:\n";
echo "----------------\n";
printUserDetails($user2);
?>
```

You can see that the lines `echo "User x details:\n";` and `echo "----------------\n";` are repeated. We can improve the code by following the DRY principle:

```php
<?php
function printUserDetails($user, $userNumber) {
    echo "User $userNumber details:\n";
    echo "----------------\n";
    echo "Name: " . $user->name . "\n";
    echo "Email: " . $user->email . "\n";
}

$user1 = (object) ["name" => "Alice", "email" => "alice@example.com"];
printUserDetails($user1, 1);

$user2 = (object) ["name" => "Bob", "email" => "bob@example.com"];
printUserDetails($user2, 2);
?>
```

In the updated code, the repetitive lines are included in the `printUserDetails` function, and we pass in the user number as an argument.

The DRY principle helps keep your codebase smaller and easier to maintain. When a change is needed, you only need to update code in one place. This minimizes the risk of bugs that occur when a change is made in one place but missed in others.
