Deeply nested code is harder to read, understand, and maintain than flat code. Each level of nesting adds an extra level of complexity.

Here's an example of deeply nested code:

```php
foreach ($items as $item) {
    if ($item->quantity > 0) {
        if ($item->price > 0) {
            $totalPrice += $item->price * $item->quantity;
        } else {
            echo "Error: Item price cannot be zero\n";
        }
    } else {
        echo "Error: Item quantity cannot be zero\n";
    }
}
```

The nested `if` statements add complexity and make the code harder to follow. One way to reduce the nesting and make the code clearer is to use early returns or continue statements. Here's the same code, but flattened:

```php
foreach ($items as $item) {
    if ($item->quantity <= 0) {
        echo "Error: Item quantity cannot be zero\n";
        continue;
    }

    if ($item->price <= 0) {
        echo "Error: Item price cannot be zero\n";
        continue;
    }

    $totalPrice += $item->price * $item->quantity;
}
```

In the flattened code, it's much clearer what each condition is checking and what will happen if the condition is met. The flow of the loop is easier to follow, as each condition results in continuing to the next iteration or performing the price calculation.

This principle of avoiding deep nesting applies to all kinds of control structures like loops, conditionals, function calls, etc., not just `if` statements. The goal is to keep the code easy to read and follow.
