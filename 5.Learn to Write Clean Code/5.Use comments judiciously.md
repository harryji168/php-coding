Comments can be extremely useful in making your code easier to understand and maintain, but they should be used judiciously and not as a replacement for clean, readable code. Here are some guidelines on how to use comments effectively:

1. **Explain your intent and reasoning:** If a piece of code needs to do something non-obvious, a comment explaining why it was written in a particular way can be very helpful. This kind of comment explains the "why" rather than the "what".

2. **Document function behavior:** Comments can be used to document the expected inputs and outputs of functions, especially for library or API code. They should explain what the function does, its parameters, its return value, and any exceptions it might throw.

3. **Don't state the obvious:** Avoid comments that simply restate what the code is doing. If the code is clear and easy to understand, no comment is necessary.

4. **Keep comments updated:** Comments that are outdated or incorrect can be more harmful than helpful. Make sure to update comments as you change your code.

Here's an example:

```php
<?php

// Incorrect use of comments
function square($number) {
  return $number * $number; // Multiply the number by itself
}

// Correct use of comments

// This function calculates the square of a number.
// 
// Parameters:
// - $number: The number to be squared. Must be an integer.
//
// Returns:
// - The square of the input number.
function square($number) {
  return $number * $number;
}

// Use of a comment to explain non-obvious code
$totalPrice = 0;

// We add an extra item to the total price for promotional reasons.
// The promotion gives one extra item for every purchase.
$totalPrice += count($items) + 1;

?>
```

In the above code, the comment in the first function is unnecessary because the code is self-explanatory. The comment in the second function is helpful because it explains what the function does and its inputs and outputs. The last comment is also useful because it explains a non-obvious part of the code.
