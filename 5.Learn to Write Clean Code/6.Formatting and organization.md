Formatting and organization are key elements of writing clean, readable code. Consistent formatting means that your code has a uniform style, such as indentation, placement of braces, usage of spaces or tabs, and other similar aspects. Organizing your code means structuring your functions, classes, and files in a logical manner. 

Here are some tips for formatting and organization in PHP:

1. **Indentation:** Use an indentation of 2-4 spaces or a tab for each code block. The PHP-FIG recommends 4 spaces for indentation. Consistent indentation makes your code easier to read.

2. **Braces:** The opening brace should be on the same line as the control structure (if, for, foreach, while, etc.) with a space before it, and the closing brace should be on its own line. This is the style recommended by the PSR-12 standard.

3. **Spaces:** There should be a space after commas in argument lists and after the control structure keywords (`if`, `for`, `while`, `switch`, etc.). 

4. **Line Length:** Try to keep the line length under 80 characters, though a limit of 120 characters is also acceptable. This makes your code easier to read in various editors and environments.

5. **Organize your classes and functions:** Group related functions together in a class. Keep the number of methods in a class as small as possible. Similarly, keep your functions and methods small.

6. **File Organization:** Each class should be in its own file and the filename should match the class name. This makes it easy to find the related code.

7. **Code Grouping:** Group related code blocks together. For instance, declare all your variables at the top of the function or method.

Here is an example that demonstrates some of these concepts:

```php
<?php
// Each class should be in its own file
class ShoppingCart {
    private $items;

    // Constructor
    public function __construct() {
        $this->items = array();
    }

    // This method adds an item to the cart
    public function addItem($item) {
        array_push($this->items, $item);
    }

    // This method calculates the total price of items in the cart
    public function calculateTotalPrice() {
        $totalPrice = 0;

        foreach($this->items as $item) {
            $totalPrice += $item->price * $item->quantity;
        }

        return $totalPrice;
    }
}

$cart = new ShoppingCart();
$cart->addItem((object) ["price" => 10, "quantity" => 2]);
$cart->addItem((object) ["price" => 20, "quantity" => 1]);

$totalPrice = $cart->calculateTotalPrice();
echo "Total price: $totalPrice\n";

?>
```

In this example, all methods related to the `ShoppingCart` are grouped in the `ShoppingCart` class, and each method does one specific thing. The code uses 4 spaces for indentation, and the braces are placed according to the PSR-12 standard. The filename for this code should be `ShoppingCart.php`, as the main class in the file is `ShoppingCart`.
