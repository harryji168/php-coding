Code reviews, also referred to as peer reviews, involve having other developers review your code. The goal of a code review is to catch bugs, improve code quality, and share knowledge among the team. Here's a general step-by-step process on how to do it:

1. **Author writes and tests the code:** The first step is to write and thoroughly test the code. Once the author is confident that the code is as good as they can make it, it is ready for review.

2. **Choose reviewers:** The author should pick colleagues to review the code. The number of reviewers can vary, but it's usually between one and three. Ideally, reviewers should be familiar with the area of code being changed.

3. **Reviewers review the code:** Reviewers go through the code and look for issues. This could include logical errors, non-adherence to coding standards, readability issues, or performance problems. Reviewers should provide actionable feedback, which means pointing out the problem and suggesting a solution.

4. **Author responds to feedback:** The author can make changes based on the feedback, or discuss the feedback with reviewers if they disagree with it. This might involve some back-and-forth until all parties are satisfied.

5. **Code gets merged:** Once all reviewers have approved the changes and any discussion has been resolved, the code can be merged into the main codebase.

Here's an example of a code review in action. Suppose we have this piece of PHP code:

```php
<?php
function getDiscountedPrice($price, $discount){
    if($discount < 0 || $discount > 100) {
        throw new InvalidArgumentException('Discount must be between 0 and 100');
    }
    return $price * ((100 - $discount) / 100);
}

$price = getDiscountedPrice(200, 20);
echo "Discounted price: $price";
?>
```

A code review for this could look like this:

**Reviewer 1:**
- **Line 3:** Good job on throwing an exception when an invalid discount is passed.
- **Line 4:** I suggest adding a comment explaining what this line does. The formula might not be immediately obvious to all readers.
- **Overall:** The function is nicely written and does only one thing, but there are no comments in the code. It would be helpful to add a comment at the start of the function explaining what it does.

Based on this review, the author might then update the code to look like this:

```php
<?php
// This function takes a price and a discount percentage and returns the discounted price.
// The discount should be a number between 0 and 100.
function getDiscountedPrice($price, $discount){
    if($discount < 0 || $discount > 100) {
        throw new InvalidArgumentException('Discount must be between 0 and 100');
    }
    // Calculate the discounted price
    return $price * ((100 - $discount) / 100);
}

$price = getDiscountedPrice(200, 20);
echo "Discounted price: $price";
?>
```

This code is much more understandable, thanks to the comments explaining what the function does and how it works. This is a simple example, but in more complex real-world scenarios, code reviews can catch bugs, architectural mistakes, or performance issues.
