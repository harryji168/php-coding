Error handling is the process of responding to and managing errors that occur during the execution of a program. It's important because it helps prevent your program from crashing and can help users understand what went wrong.

In PHP, errors can be handled in several ways:

1. **Custom error handler:** You can set your own error handling function with `set_error_handler()`. Your function can process the error however you like, such as by logging it or displaying a user-friendly message.

2. **Try-catch blocks:** Exceptions are a type of error that can be "thrown" and "caught". When an exception is thrown, the normal flow of the program is interrupted and the program looks for a matching "catch" block to handle the exception.

Here's an example of both techniques:

```php
<?php

// Custom error handler
function custom_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile, $errline) {
    echo "An error occurred: [$errno] $errstr - $errfile:$errline\n";
    die(); // Stop script after the error
}
set_error_handler("custom_error_handler");

// Generate an error
echo $undefined_var;

// Exception handling with try-catch block
try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
    $value = 0;
    if ($value == 0) {
        throw new Exception('Division by zero');
    }
    echo 10 / $value;
} catch (Exception $e) {
    // Handle the exception
    echo "Caught exception: ",  $e->getMessage(), "\n";
}

?>
```

In this example, the `custom_error_handler` function is called when an error occurs (like trying to echo an undefined variable). Then, the script attempts to divide by zero inside a `try` block. Because dividing by zero is not allowed, an `Exception` is thrown. The `catch` block catches the exception and handles it by displaying a message.

The `die()` function in the error handler function is used to stop the script after an error. Depending on the situation, you might want to do this, or you might want to allow the script to continue running if it can recover from the error. You should make this decision based on the specific needs of your program.
