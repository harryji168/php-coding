Databases are used to store, retrieve, change, and manage data. They play a critical role in various applications, from simple web applications to large-scale business systems.

There are mainly two types of databases: **Relational** and **NoSQL** databases.

1. **Relational Databases (RDBMS)**: Relational databases are based on the relational model, where data is stored in tables with rows and columns. These tables are related to each other based on certain conditions, which makes the relational model highly flexible. Examples of relational databases are MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Oracle Database.

   Key concepts in relational databases include tables, rows, columns, keys (primary, foreign), and relations (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many). SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to manipulate and query data in relational databases.

2. **NoSQL Databases**: These databases are non-relational and can store and retrieve data in various ways, such as document-based, column-based, key-value pairs, or graph databases. They are designed for distributed data stores with large scale data storage needs. Examples of NoSQL databases are MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and Neo4j.

Here's an example of how to connect to a MySQL database using PHP and retrieve data:

```php
<?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "username";
$password = "password";
$dbname = "myDB";

// Create connection
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}

$sql = "SELECT id, firstname, lastname FROM MyGuests";
$result = $conn->query($sql);

if ($result->num_rows > 0) {
    // output data of each row
    while($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
        echo "id: " . $row["id"]. " - Name: " . $row["firstname"]. " " . $row["lastname"]. "<br>";
    }
} else {
    echo "0 results";
}
$conn->close();
?>
```

This PHP script connects to a MySQL database using the `mysqli` extension, executes a `SELECT` SQL statement to retrieve data from the `MyGuests` table, and prints the id, first name, and last name of each record.

Remember, always handle your database connections and queries carefully to avoid SQL injection and other potential vulnerabilities. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements as much as possible.
