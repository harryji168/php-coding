Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store that is often used as a database, cache, and message broker. It has built-in replication features that allow you to create exact copies of your data, with one Redis server acting as the master and one or more Redis servers acting as slaves. This process allows you to have redundant copies of your data for backup and read-heavy load balancing.

Here are the steps to set up Redis replication:

1. **Master Server:** Run your master Redis server as you normally would. For example, you might start it with the default configuration by simply using the command `redis-server`.

2. **Slave Servers:** On each of your slave servers, you'll need to tell Redis to replicate the master server. You can do this by either setting the `slaveof` directive in your configuration file, or by running the `SLAVEOF` command in the Redis command-line interface. For example, if your master server is running on `127.0.0.1:6379`, you could use the command `SLAVEOF 127.0.0.1 6379` to start replication.

Once you've set up replication, you can use PHP to interact with your Redis servers. For this, you'll need the Redis extension for PHP. Here's an example of how you might connect to a Redis server and perform a basic operation:

```php
<?php
$redis = new Redis();

// Connecting to the master server
$redis->connect('127.0.0.1', 6379);
echo "Connected to the master server\n";

// Setting a value on the master
$redis->set('key', 'value');
echo "Set 'key' to 'value' on the master server\n";

// Connecting to a slave server
$redis->connect('localhost', 6380);
echo "Connected to the slave server\n";

// Getting the value from the slave
$value = $redis->get('key');
echo "Got 'key' as '$value' from the slave server\n";
?>
```

This code connects to the master server, sets a value, then connects to a slave server and retrieves the value. The retrieved value on the slave should be the same as the value set on the master, showing that replication is working correctly.

Please note that the sample code is a simplistic example and assumes that you have Redis installed and correctly set up on the addresses and ports provided. In a real-world scenario, you might have different Redis instances for the master and slave servers. Furthermore, consider using proper error handling, connection checking, and close connections when they are no longer needed.
